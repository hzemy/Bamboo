# Bamboo

Purpose
Many people are interested in keeping track of their eating, exercise, and sleeping habits to monitor their progress with various health goals. While there are many existing health and lifestyle apps, they each have their drawbacks, including having a narrow set of features, a steep learning curve, or premium paywall. Existing apps that help monitor health goals are often specific to one aspect of health, like exercise, making it more work for the user to keep up with multiple platforms and enter a lot of data each day. This is time consuming and inconvenient, leaving most users frustrated with the options currently available.

Bamboo will be an all-in-one mobile application to keep track of your health and wellness-related habits and find out the best way to go about achieving your goals.
Users can set multiple highly customizable goals and track how well they are meeting these goals on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. In addition to this, Bamboo will be tailored to the individual user’s needs. There will be functionality to recommend meals and exercise routines catered to the user’s health attributes and goals.

After reviewing the existing fitness goal apps, we also found many of them to be visually overwhelming, and with too many features for the casual user to handle. We are instead going for a simple and intuitive design, to make our user experience as smooth as possible.

We are designing a cross platform mobile application to serve this purpose. We will develop a React Native based front end, a MongoDB database, a NodeJS based back end, and a Spring Boot web service to service requests from the front end to the database.
